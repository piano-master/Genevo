# The Genevo Project
Double-Elimination Tournament Bracket Simulator

The Genevo Project is a program that takes input files containing data from previous data, and is able to predict the results
of any future tournament given the competitors that will be in attendance. The Genevo Project is primarily designed for 
fighting game tournaments. It analyzes previous set records of various competitors as well as character matchups.

This program was designed specifically to help users create successful fantasy brackets on smash.gg, but there are still improvements
that need to be made to before this can be considered a completed project. It can currently output the most probable results, but
in the future, I would like to add more features to this program that increase the amount of output data for the user.

To run "The Genevo Project", run Tourney_Predictor.exe in a C/C++ compilier (I recommend Cygwin). After attempting to run Tourney_Predictor.exe, an error message will appear explaining what arguments need to be added to the command line.
